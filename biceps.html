        <h2>Biceps Workout</h2>

        <ol>
            <h2><li>Dumbell Curl</li></h2>
            <img src="dumbellcurl.jpg" alt="dumbell curl">
            <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> The standard shoulder-width curl engages the short and long heads of the biceps equally, you can alter grip width to slightly change the emphasis (wide to target the short head, narrow for the long head), you can really pile on the weight, and you don't have to sit there endlessly working one arm at a time.</p>
            <p><b>In your workout:</b> Hit your heavy curls at the beginning of your biceps workout when you can really challenge yourself with weight. For a bit more of a strength stimulus, choose a weight you can handle for about 6-8 reps, or even a classic size-and-strength rep range like 5x5. A common biceps blunder is rocking your body excessively on this movement. Keep it strict for the most part, especially when you're going heavy</p>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Stand straight with a dumbbell in each hand, your feet shoulder-width apart, and hands by your sides.</li>
                <li>Squeeze the biceps and lift the dumbbells. ...</li>
                <li>Once the dumbbells are at shoulder level, slowly lower the arms to the starting position.</li>
                <li>Repeat.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2><li>Cable Curl</li></h2>
            <img src="cablecurl.jpg" alt="cable curl">
            <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> This movement seems a lot like the standing barbell curl at first glance. After all, they're both bilateral movements in which you take a shoulder-width, underhand grip on the bar. What makes it different is that, like all of the best muscle-building cable exercises, the angle of loading gives you constant tension on the muscle through the full range of motion.</p>
            <p><b>In your workout:</b> Because it's fairly similar to the barbell curl, pick one or the other. If you're doing it first in your workout, go fairly heavy and use a challenging weight for 6-10 reps per set. If you choose to do it later in the workout, go for 8-12 or more per set.</p>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Curl the cable weight upward, toward the chest, while breathing out. Only the forearms move, rising up from the elbow.</li>
                <li>Hold at the top of the contraction for one second.</li>
                <li>Lower the forearms to the starting position on an inhale. Stop before the weights return to the stack, keeping the cable under tension.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2><li>Chin-up</li></h2>
            <img src="chinup.jpg" alt="Chin up">
            <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> Ever done a set of max-rep chins? Then you know the biceps are working seriously hard during this move. Both pull-ups (overhand grip) and chin-ups (underhand grip) have a high degree of elbow flexion, but research has shown that chin-ups work the biceps significantly more.</p>
            <p><b>In your workout:</b> If you train back with biceps, this exercise could make a great bridge movement between the two body parts for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps. It can also be your primary upper-back and biceps move in a home workout if you take a few sets to failure, like in strength coach Paul Carter's program Jacked at Home: Bodyweight Muscle-Building Workouts.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Grab a pull-up bar. Kollath says that your palms should be facing you and your arms should be shoulder-width apart.</li>
                <li>Engage your upper back and core. ...</li>
                <li>Continuing to hold on to the bar, lift your chest up toward it. ...</li>
                <li>Slowly lower yourself until you are back to your starting position, and repeat.</li>
            </ol>
