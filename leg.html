        <h2>Leg Workout</h2>
    </div>
    <h2>Why Training Legs Is So Important</h2>
        <p>First and foremost, leg exercises target some of your body’s biggest muscles – the largest being your glutes – the foundations on which your fitness is built. Training legs means burning more calories, elevating your T-levels, boosting your big lifts, improving your mobility, and, of course, building strength, power and mass.</p>
        <p>You might not know it, but leg exercises are also critical to brain and nervous system health. Your wheels send important signals to the brain that help produce neural cells (essential for handling stress and adapting to challenges) in particular during weight-bearing exercise, research published in Frontiers revealed.</p>
        <h2>Why you Shouldn't Skip Leg Day</h2>
        <p>On the flip side, skipping leg day one too many times can make you unbalanced and more susceptible to injury.</p>
        <p>Need more convincing? How about this: performing single-leg exercises, like the Bulgarian spilt squat, pistol squat and single leg curl listed below, won't just good give you powerful legs, it'll also help you to engage your core muscles and develop better balance. If you're already injured moves like these are good for rehabilitation, since working one side of the body can stimulate the same muscles on the other side of the body too.</p>

                <li>Pause at the top of the movement. Do not lock out your knees, and ensure that they are not bowing out or in.</li>
                <li>While inhaling, return the footplate to the starting position by gradually bending the knees. Keep the feet and back flat throughout.</li>
                <li>Repeat.</li>
